4. On Github WEBSITE: make pull request to master (can I merge two branches?)
5. On Github WEBSITE: Send code review request to a partner
6. On Github WEBSITE: After approval merge new branch to master
7. On Github WEBSITE: delete old branch
8. On your local machine delete old branch
9. from your machine terminal do pull request: git pull origin master
