class Logger(object):
    '''
    Utility class responsible for logging all interactions of note during the
    simulation.
    _____Attributes______
    file_name: the name of the file that the logger will be writing to.
    _____Methods_____
    __init__(self, file_name):
    write_metadata(self, pop_size, vacc_percentage, virus_name, mortality_rate,
        basic_repro_num):
        - Writes the first line of a logfile, which will contain metadata on the
            parameters for the simulation.
    log_interaction(self, person1, person2, did_infect=None, person2_vacc=None, person2_sick=None):
        - Expects person1 and person2 as person objects.
        - Expects did_infect, person2_vacc, and person2_sick as Booleans, if passed.
        - Between the values passed with did_infect, person2_vacc, and person2_sick, this method
            should be able to determine exactly what happened in the interaction and create a String
            saying so.
        - The format of the log should be "{person1.ID} infects {person2.ID}", or, for other edge
            cases, "{person1.ID} didn't infect {person2.ID} because {'vaccinated' or 'already sick'}"
        - Appends the interaction to logfile.
    log_infection_survival(self, person, did_die_from_infection):
        - Expects person as Person object.
        - Expects bool for did_die_from_infection, with True denoting they died from
            their infection and False denoting they survived and became immune.
        - The format of the log should be "{person.ID} died from infection" or
            "{person.ID} survived infection."
        - Appends the results of the infection to the logfile.
    log_time_step(self, time_step_number):
        - Expects time_step_number as an Int.
        - This method should write a log telling us when one time step ends, and
            the next time step begins.  The format of this log should be:
                "Time step {time_step_number} ended, beginning {time_step_number + 1}..."
        - STRETCH CHALLENGE DETAILS:
            - If you choose to extend this method, the format of the summary statistics logged
                are up to you.  At minimum, it should contain:
                    - The number of people that were infected during this specific time step.
                    - The number of people that died on this specific time step.
                    - The total number of people infected in the population, including the newly
                        infected
                    - The total number of dead, including those that died during this time step.

        # (each item separated by a '\t' character).

        # that we will store all logs in.  Be sure to use 'w' mode when you open the file.

        # since 'w' overwrites the file.

        # person2 (the person randomly chosen for the interaction), and the optional
        # keyword arguments passed into the method.  See documentation for more info
        # on the format of the logs that this method should write.

        # NOTE: Stretch challenge opportunity! Modify this method so that at the end of each time
        # step, it also logs a summary of what happened in that time step, including the number of
        # people infected, the number of people dead, etc.  You may want to create a helper class
        # to compute these statistics for you, as a Logger's job is just to write logs!

        # event logged ends up on a separate line!
